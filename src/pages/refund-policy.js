              <h2 className="pp-title">1. Overview </h2>
              <p className="urbanist-black-16">
                In terms of high performance nft, metaverse website and web3,we
                take great satisfaction in offering the finest. Spending your
                hard-earned money just to be dissatisfied with your purchase is,
                as we all know, the worst possible scenario. We also understand
                that managing a server may be a difficult undertaking that
                overwhelms many individuals, and because of this, we also
                believe in treating our customers fairly and providing a
                realistic guarantee that they'll be happy with the service we
                offer. The scenarios listed below may indicate different ways to
                obtain a full or partial refund; nonetheless, NFT CONSTRUCTER
                maintains the right, in its sole discretion, to deny a refund
                request for any reason or no reason.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h2 className="pp-title">2. Refunds </h2>
              <p className="urbanist-black-16">
                Refunds may be applied as credit in U.S. dollars or returned to
                the original credit/debit card or crypto currency account that
                was used to make the purchase. Refunds in the form of credit
                will be credited right away to the customer's account. We urge
                our clients to give us up to 5 business days for credit/debit
                card refunds to appear in their account balance. In rare
                circumstances, processing credit or debit cards could take up to
                7 working days.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h2 className="pp-title">3. Seven Day Guarantee </h2>
              <p className="urbanist-black-16">
                with the services they have purchased within the first 168 hours
                (7 days) of their purchase, provided they meet the requirements
                outlined in this section. Over the lifespan of the customer's
                account, this guarantee is only good for one service per
                customer. To request a refund, get in touch with customer care
                within the first seven days of your purchase. Before you go, we
                only need a response to one last query: what can we do to
                improve our services going forward?
              </p>
              <br />
              <h2 className="pp-title">4. Mid-service Cancellation </h2>
              <p className="urbanist-black-16">
                Mid-service cancellation is not guaranteed to result in a refund
                after our seven-day guarantee mentioned in section III has
                expired. NFT CONSTRUCTER has the right to assign credit,
                although each situation is examined individually.

              <h2 className="pp-title">
                5. Downtime, Outage, or System Failure Guarantee{" "}
              </h2>
              <p className="urbanist-black-16">
                You can be eligible for a partial credit refund or an extension
                of service time if our hardware, network, or service platform
                malfunctions continuously for a period of time longer than one
                hour. System upkeep and repair time is not considered or
                accounted for when calculating service downtime. Prolonged or
                unexpected maintenance may be eligible, solely at the discretion
                of NFT CONSTRUCTER. To determine whether a refund could be
                possible, you would need to contact support. There is no
                assurance that any hostile assaults on our hardware, network, or
                services will result in a refund. Refunds are also not available
                for any customized software that the customer installed
                themselves or on their own and that results in incorrect issues,
                failed (crashed) services, or downtime.
              </p>
              <br />

              <h2 className="pp-title">6. Eligible Services </h2>
              <p className="urbanist-black-16">
                Unfortunately, not all of our services or offerings is subject
                to a refund. Refunds may be available for any of our shared game
                servers, web hosting, or telephony services. SSL Certificates,
                dedicated servers, and domain transfers may not be eligible for
                a refund and there is no assurance that they will.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h2 className="pp-title">7. Payment Disputes </h2>
              <p className="urbanist-black-16">
                If a customer ever believes that we have done them wrong, we
                politely request that they contact us first to work out a
                solution before filing a chargeback or dispute with their
                payment processor. When requesting a refund, kindly avoid
                opening a dispute or chargeback because doing so would simply
                make the process take longer. Regardless of the resolution,
                every issue harms our company's standing with our payment
                gateways. In order to send a report to the payment gateway that
                has received the dispute, we combine logs of service use,
                payment authorization, timestamps, IP logs, and support
                conversations.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h2 className="pp-title">8: Chargeback and Refund Fees </h2>
              <p className="urbanist-black-16">
                The customer is liable for paying the fee and may be billed for
                it if at any point a chargeback or refund results in a fee being
                charged to NFT CONSTRUCTER Inc. by a payment gateway from a
                payment made by the customer. In accordance with our Conditions
                of Service section IIIa, unpaid chargeback costs will be
                assigned to a collection firm.
